TOTURIAL/Services :
1-HeroesComponent will be lean and focused on supporting the view ( represents the data )
[ Components shouldn't fetch or save data directly and they certainly shouldn't knowingly present fake data.
 They should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service.]

 2-I'll create a HeroService that all application classes can use to get heroes.

 3-instead of creating that service with new, you'll rely on Angular dependency injection 
 to inject it into the HeroesComponent constructor.

 4-You must provide the HeroService in the dependency injection system before Angular can 
 inject it into the HeroesComponent, as you will do below.

5-There are several ways to provide the HeroService: 
in the HeroesComponent, 
in the AppComponent, 
in the AppModule. Each option has pros and cons.
